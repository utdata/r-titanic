Preparing data from the Titanic for various lessons.

I'm looking at two different sources:

- The [Titanic R package](https://github.com/paulhendricks/titanic).
- The [Titanic Facts website](https://titanicfacts.net/titanic-passenger-list/)

There are some columns in each data set that are not in the other, though perhaps those columns are not that useful.

I'm going with the R package data as it is more consistent.
