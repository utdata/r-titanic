Preparing data from the Titanic for various lessons.

I'm looking at two different sources:

- The [Titanic R package](https://github.com/paulhendricks/titanic).
- The [Titanic Facts website](https://titanicfacts.net/titanic-passenger-list/)

There are some columns in each data set that are not in the other, though perhaps those columns are not that useful.

I'm leaning toward the Titanic Facts data because it has more records and seems to be geared toward record keeping vs data science.
